# Aurora Relayer SQL Dumps

## Prehistory Dumps

Prehistorical blocks are the blocks prior to Aurora Engine (the EVM
implementation) being available on the chain. By definition, such blocks
will not have contained any EVM transactions.

### `aurora-testnet-prehistory.sql.xz`

This dump includes the first 47,354,108 blocks (genesis through #47354107)

The [Aurora Engine 1.0] release was deployed to Testnet in block #47354108.

### `aurora-mainnet-prehistory.sql.xz`
